# Custom Error Page

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with a set of static web assets. 
Your task is to implement an HTTP server to serve up these assets when they are requested. 
A request to a specific asset should return that asset (ex. index.html). A request to a non-existent 
asset should result in the user seeing the 404.html page. 
This exercise will be completed in class.
